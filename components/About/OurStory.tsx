          Our journey began with a simple observation: too many seniors in
          Nigeria face barriers to consistent, quality healthcare. From long
          queues at hospitals to difficulty traveling for routine care, the
          system wasnâ€™t built with their needs in mind. <br />
          <br />
          Rockbalm Health was created to change that. We set out to bring care
          closer to where it matters most home so that seniors and their
          caregivers can spend less time worrying about logistics and more time
          focusing on health and quality of life.
